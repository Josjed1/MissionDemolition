# MissionDemolition
Project 2 for Game Design
## I decided to create a speed up button that doubles the speed of the game, I found this funtion nice because it would get annoying if I missed completly and I find that it helps make the game more enjoyable
## I was original planning to add a coin system but ran into trouble but liked the astetic it left so I decided to keep them in as well, I also felt like it was pointless because there wasn't a reason to collect them.
